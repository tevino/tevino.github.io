    <p>The requirement is VLAN single-line multiplexing. Although IPTV is not needed, I need to switch the network port in the weak current box to a router in another room through a single line, while also accommodating dial-up. Gigabit switching is adequate and a more practical choice after considering the current popularity and cost effectiveness of higher bandwidth devices.</p>
<p>In theory, this requirement could be met by configuring the telecom optical modem. However, after configuration, PPPOE would disconnect periodically, and the modem‚Äôs DHCP couldn‚Äôt be completely turned off. Even after disabling it, devices on the LAN port would sometimes still be assigned IPs, seemingly as a result of some detection mechanism by the telecom company. Service personnel came to replace the modem, but it didn‚Äôt solve the problem, and they weren‚Äôt clear on the details. So I decided not to rely on external uncontrollable devices<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, and instead add a switch in the weak current box to achieve this.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefhttpswwwmercurycomcomcnproduct-339-1htmlmercury-sg105-proa"><a href="https://www.mercurycom.com.cn/product-339-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury SG105 Pro</a></h2>
<p>This is a relatively inexpensive managed switch among common brands. The configuration UI is very basic. For example, IGMP Snooping only has on/off options, Link Aggregation has no mode or protocol selection, and there‚Äôs no separate documentation. However, the UI does have simple one or two-sentence text help. Additionally, I found this to be my only network device that doesn‚Äôt support an English UI.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/sg105-ui-1.png" alt="Management backend screenshot 1"></p>
<p><img src="/assets/sg105-ui-2.png" alt="Management backend screenshot 2"></p>
<p>Although the UI isn‚Äôt very user-friendly, it‚Äôs simple enough. After basic configuration, it quickly worked as expected. However, in the management backend statistics, I noticed some ‚Äúfailed packet receptions‚Äù. The proportion wasn‚Äôt high, about one every six seconds, and there were no packet losses or errors on the devices at the other end during the same period. By swapping network cables and ports, I ruled out factors related to ports and cables. Currently, I‚Äôve observed that ‚Äúfailed packet receptions‚Äù only occur on ports where the other end is a router, and I haven‚Äôt noticed any obvious network issues in use. I tried adjusting configurations like RSTP and IGMP Snooping, but the problem persisted. I don‚Äôt plan to spend more time investigating it for now.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/sg105-failure.png" alt="Management backend failed packet reception screenshot"></p>
<p>The same phenomenon has been observed by others online, with some saying it affected IPTV<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, and some users found that there would be no failed packet receptions as long as hybrid<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> ports were not configured<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>. However, hybrid is one of my requirements.</p>
<p>I reported the situation to Mercury‚Äôs official technical support. They said if there were no network problems, I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it. They said this issue would be reported for fixing, but there were no current plans. From their tone, it seemed like a known issue, and there‚Äôs a possibility it could cause network problems.</p>
<p>I checked the official firmware, and the latest version is also the only version, released six years ago: <code>1.0.0 Build 20180515 Rel.60684</code>. Although I haven‚Äôt found any problems so far<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>, I don‚Äôt really believe this product will release new firmware to solve any issues in the future, so I plan to replace it.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefhttpswwwnetgearcomsupportproductgs105ev2netgear-gs105e-v2asup-classfootnote-refa-hreffn6-idfnref66asup">
<a href="https://www.netgear.com/support/product/gs105ev2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NETGEAR GS105e v2</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
</h2>
<p>This switch is very similar to the previous one in terms of specifications - gigabit, five ports, simple management. The UI structure is also very similar, making me suspect they use the same main controller.</p>
<p>After examining teardowns of both devices(<a href="https://youtu.be/wibHqsDoqMw?t=269" title="Netgear GS105e Full Teardown Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/KL85i8kUjZM?t=23" title="Mercury SG105 Pro teardown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>) and disassembling them myself, I feel that NETGEAR‚Äôs overall material quality is better<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>. I had considered that Mercury‚Äôs simpler PCB might have a lower failure rate, but the 2.5 million hour MTBF in <a href="https://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/Plus_Switches/Gigabit_Ethernet_Plus_Switches_DS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NETGEAR‚Äôs manual</a> alleviated my concerns.</p>
<p>This switch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacks Link Aggregation</li>
<li>Allows adding descriptions to ports</li>
<li>Has synchronized LED flashing when a loop is detected</li>
<li>Supports enabling DHCP while using a backup static address</li>
<li>Has no bugs in the cable test‚Äôs ‚Äúselect all‚Äù function
<ul>
<li>Doesn‚Äôt show distance when cable is normally connected, and test results are stable (Mercury shows distance<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>, but results can vary by tens of meters across multiple tests)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has safeguards in VLAN configuration
<ul>
<li>For example, it requires setting the port PVID before removing a port from the only VLAN</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supports both 802.1p and DSCP simultaneously (Mercury only allows choosing one)</li>
<li>UI supports English, German, and Japanese</li>
<li>Has detailed built-in help, often requiring scrolling</li>
<li>Has ACL and no username for login (a scientifically designed single-user system)</li>
<li>Device discovery tool supports macOS, Linux, and Windows</li>
<li>Supports power-saving mode (IEEE 802.3az), with a maximum power consumption of 2.6W
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, Mercury‚Äôs packaging, manual, and website have no information about power consumption. Is this even compliant?</li>
<li>In actual tests, with four ports in use, both devices were around 1.7 watts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/gs105-ui.png" alt="NETGEAR management backend screenshot"></p>
<p>NETGEAR is significantly better than Mercury in terms of firmware updates. As a currently sold model, this switch has had 11 updates from the initial <code>v1.2.0.5</code> to <code>v1.6.0.11</code>, with the most recent on 2021-11-12, indicating it‚Äôs a product still maintained by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>NETGEAR‚Äôs cable testing is also quite useful. It can detect impedance mismatch issues (which Mercury doesn‚Äôt handle<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>, reporting a 10+ meter cable as 80+ meters). If it‚Äôs not a pre-made network cable, the probability of connection end issues is likely higher than cable material issues. My test results so far show that my recently crimped RJ45 connectors are fine, but older ones were detected as mismatched<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>. When I have the chance to borrow tools and replace the old connectors, I‚Äôll update with the new test results.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/gs105-cable-tester-result.png" alt="Cable test results"></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Previously, I had a poor impression of NETGEAR devices‚Äîexpensive and slow. However, this time was different. The NETGEAR device started working normally even faster than Mercury after powering on. Additionally, NETGEAR adheres well to various industry standards, has reassuring product quality, and provides comprehensive documentation. It might not be entirely fair to compare Mercury with it, given the price difference, but this experience has refreshed my perception of NETGEAR, and I‚Äôm very satisfied.</p>
